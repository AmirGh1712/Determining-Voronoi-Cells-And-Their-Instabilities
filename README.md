# Determining Voronoi Cells And Their Instabilities
 Given a discrete set of points in space, the Voronoi cell of each point is the region of space closer to it than to any other point. These regions are convex polyhedra, and their combinatorics are determined by the relative positions of the neighboring points. In many situations, small perturbations of the points do not change the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the Voronoi cells; we call such Voronoi cells stable. In some cases, however, small perturbations do change the number of vertices, edges, and faces of adjacent Voronoi cells; we call these unstable.
